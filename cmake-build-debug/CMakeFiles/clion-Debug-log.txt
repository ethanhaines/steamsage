CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibpqxx.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "libpqxx", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libpqxx" with any
  of the following names:

    libpqxxConfig.cmake
    libpqxx-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libpqxx" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libpqxx_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "libpqxx" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
